Welcome to Indian Genetic Disease Database v2

The Indians represent one-sixth of the world population and India consists of ethnically, geographically and genetically diverse 
populations with several thousand endogamous groups. In some community the load of genetic disorder is relatively high due to 
consanguineous marriage practiced in the community. This database has been created to keep track of mutations in the causal genes for 
genetic diseases common in India and help the Physicians, Geneticists and other professionals related to genetic disorders to 
retrieve and use the information for the benefit of the families affected with the disorders.
